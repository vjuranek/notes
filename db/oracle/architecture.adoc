= Oracle architecture notes

== Multitenancy

* online redo log files and achive files are always in `CDB` and to manage them, one has to log in into `CDB$ROOT`, not into PDB
* `PDB$SEED` - temlate for PDBs for creating user PDBs

=== Object names

* `USER_*` - objects owned by the user
* `ALL_*` - objects accessible by the current user
* `DBA_*` - objects withing current container (being it CDB or PDB)
* `CDB_*` - objects in the CDB
* `V$*` - SGA accessed by the all containers

* `CON_ID` - `0` for CDB, `1` for `CDB$ROOT`, `2` for `PDB$SEED`, `>2` for PDBs

== Memory

* `PGA` - program global area - areas dedicated to each client session, each connected client has its own server process and each server process has its own PGA
  * SQL work area
  * session memory
* `SGA` - system global area
  * shared pool - stores pl/sql code executed by connected users, data dictionary of accessed objects
    * library cache
    * data dictionary cache
    * result cache
    * UGA (user global area)
  * DB bugger cache - data block requested by connected users
    * disk writer (DBWn) writes data block to the data files
  * redo log buffer - redo entries
  * large pool - buffer for some operations (RMAN, UGA etc), shared pool is used if the large pool is not configured
  * shared flashback buffer - use by flashback operations
  * fixed SGA
  * Java pool - for executing java code


=== Log Writer (LGWR)

* writes records from Redo log buffer to Online redo log file
* the writing is triggered when
  * user transaction is committed
  * redo log buffer is 1/3 full
  * before DB writer (DBWn) writes modified buffers to the disk
  * every 3 seconds otherwise

Online redo log files are typically in 3 groups.
Once LGWR fill all the groups, it starts writing again into the first group.
